# Git commit

1. Run in parallel: `git status`, `git diff` (staged + unstaged), `git log -5 --oneline`.
2. Do not commit `.env`, credentials, or secret files. Warn if the user asks to include them.
3. Stage only relevant files. Follow the repo’s recent commit message style.
4. Prefer a short message focused on **why** / the real product or behavior change, then commit via HEREDOC:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Short summary of why.

EOF
)"
```

**Message focus (mandatory):**
- Lead with the actual feature, fix, or UX/behavior change in the diff.
- **Never** mention unit tests, test files, Jest, coverage, `__tests__`, or phrases like “add/update tests” — even if the commit includes them, even if the commit is mostly tests.
- If the commit is test-only, still phrase the message as the behavior/area covered (e.g. `Harden nav menu visibility prefs edge cases`), not as “add unit tests…”.
- Example: prefer `Persist list filters per user in localStorage` over `Add unit tests for persisted filters`.

5. Run `git status` after. Do not push unless asked. Do not amend unless the user requested it and safety rules allow.
6. Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly asks.
